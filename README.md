# linkAI - Advanced Blockchain Analytics

## 🤖 Overview
linkAI is a sophisticated blockchain analysis tool powered by artificial intelligence, designed to track and analyze Solana blockchain and PumpFun platform activities. Our proprietary algorithms leverage advanced mathematical models and machine learning techniques to provide real-time insights and predictive analytics.

## 🧮 Core Analytics Engine

### Volume Analysis Algorithm
Our volume analysis implements a multi-dimensional time series model:

```math
V(t) = α∑(v_i * w_i) + β∫(p(t) * v(t))dt

where:
- V(t) = Volume at time t
- α = Market depth coefficient
- v_i = Individual transaction volumes
- w_i = Transaction weight factors
- β = Price-volume correlation factor
- p(t) = Price function
```

### Momentum Detection System
Utilizes a composite momentum indicator based on:
- RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- Volume-weighted price analysis
- Neural network pattern recognition

```math
M = ∑(RSI_w * RSI + MACD_w * MACD + VPA_w * VPA)
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics

Our performance scoring system uses a proprietary algorithm:

```math
Score = min(Tx_score + Balance_score + WinRate_score, 100)

where:
Tx_score = min(transactions/1000 * 40, 40)
Balance_score = min(sol_balance * 2, 30)
WinRate_score = win_rate * 3
```
